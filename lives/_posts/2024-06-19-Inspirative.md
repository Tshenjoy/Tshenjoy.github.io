The last time I came to this venue (and also the first time) was for Inspirative's show last summer.
I think i still kept the ticket stub from their last year tour.

MAO seems to be a bad choice generally for live band shows. I've heard complaints about the sound system and also the people who go there. It is now more of a place for people to hang out and drink, rather than a place for music. But Inspirative's show was good. They brought their own tuner and the sound was even better than last year. There are some new VJs for almost every song now.

Their performance filled with genuine emotions and sincerity. It's really moving to see a show that both the performer and the audience are so devoted to.

I'm glad that I came to see them again. Hope they'll come back next year.

*Side note*: I remembered that the floor was sticky last year. Maybe too many people vomited there (maybe that's what you can expect at a night-club-ish venue). They seems to have retiled the floor this year. Haha 

[24/6/22] Their show at Nanjing 1701 seems to be strictly timed and ended before 10 p.m.. Their manager complaint about the regulation and the discrimination to bands from Thailand.
